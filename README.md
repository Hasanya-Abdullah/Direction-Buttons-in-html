# Methodology:
In this project, there are four direction buttons with two more buttons. The forward, backward, left, right, stop and retrieve the last record buttons. We want to keep records of the directions and retrieve the last record with the help of JavaScript and PHP. JavaScript helps with navigating to the PHP page and also with sending the values of the directions when clicking on a specific button. PHP helps connect, insert, and retrieve the direction records from the database.
